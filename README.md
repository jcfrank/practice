my python practice project

huffman
====

My practice project after re-visited the Huffman code in Data structure.

how-to
----

Both tree.py and huffman.py are needed.

  import huffman
  
  huffman.encode('some words that needs to encode')
  
The function will return a tuple. First value is a dict that contains encode info.
The second is the encoded bits.
